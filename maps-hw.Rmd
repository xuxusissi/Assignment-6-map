##Crooklets Beach

Crooklets is at the north side of Bude and can be reached by a short walk over the Summerleaze Down or down the hill from the town centre. Crooklets is very popular with surfers and is home to the Bude Surf Life Saving Club.  The beach has great facilities including a large car park, level access and viewing area, a play area, skate park, beach cafe, showers, amusements and pubs close by.  


##Summerleaze Beach

Summerleaze has a unique appeal, not least because it is less than five minutesâ€™ walk from the centre of Bude and the large car park leads directly to the sand dunes. The river, with its bobbing fishing boats, flanks the wide, sandy beach that is sheltered by the impressive breakwater, making the beach particularly popular with families and surfers.
